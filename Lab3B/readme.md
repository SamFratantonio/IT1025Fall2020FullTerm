## Career Exploration

#### Tri-C College Central: 
* Register for a student account.
* Use one of the search options such as "Search - Intern Central," take a screenshot of the listings (include your name in the upper right-hand corner in your screenshot,)  name the file: CollegeCentral and upload to your lab folder. 

#### Bureau of Labor Statistics
* Go to: Bureau of Labor Statistics website and continue exploring careers in IT (or your area of interest.) You can search for "web developer" or "network" or "cyber" and see what jobs appear.
Report your findings including job title, salary and projected growth. You can upload a screenshot if you want.

A job I found that I'm interested in is software developer. This was actually what I had in mind when I enrolled. 
According to bls.gov, the median pay for software developers is $107,510 per year, or $51.69 per hour. 
A bachelor's degree is required for a large portion of software developers. 
One thing I found interesting is there is little on the job training. 
Employment of software developers is supposed to grow 22% in the next ten years, which is high. 

## Industry Certification
* Explore a certification and report your findings. (CompTIA , Cisco , CISSP or any other certification)

When I was in high school I went to CVCC part time and we actually did the Cisco certification tests as part of the class. 
So I think I'll continue with that.

## College Certificates
* Explore the Tri-C certificates at: Tri-C IT Programs and report on a certificate of interest (short-term or post-degree.)
* Explain what you need to do to become co-op "ready" and the benefits of pursuing a co-op or internship

## Professional Membership
* Pick one of the IT organizations like IEEE or ACM or a student club and report the purpose of the organization and why membership would be beneficial.
