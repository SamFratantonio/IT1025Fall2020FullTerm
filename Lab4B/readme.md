# Executive Summary
Explain the goal for this lab

# LucidChart

Create a new blank diagram (ignore message boxes to upgrade) and create a flowchart for a computer program that
asks for a number and then
* prints "Big" if the number is greater than 10
* prints "Small" if the number is less than 10.
Use the following resource (or one of your choice) as a guide: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/programming_methodologies/programming_methodologies_flowchart_elements.htm Add a textbox to the chart with your name

Download your chart as a jpg file and name it: DecisionFlowchart and upload the file to your GitHub lab folder

I found it to be very helpful. The general design was very straightforward and easy to understand. If I have to make flowcharts or things of that nature in the future I'll probably use it. 

# Networking
## Intro to Networking
Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions 

Words:
* Packet - Unit of data
* Packet-Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address
* IP Address - Unique identifying number
* DNS - Directory of IP address common names.
* Protocol - Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

Definitions to match:
* Set of rules to allow devices to communicate
* Unit of data
* Unique identifying number
* Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address
* Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com)

## Network Hardware
* Explain the benefit of a switch over a hub.
    * Switches are much more efficient. With hubs only one device can use it at a time, but with switches multiple can. Switches also can store information such as MAC addresses which makes connecting with other devices on the network easier.
* Explain the benefit of a router over hubs and switches.
    * Simply put, routers form wireless connections with the devices on the network. This gives it a much larger range and makes everything easier as the devices can be set up in virtually whatever way you want. 

## Network Topology
* Explain: Single point of failure and the topologies that experience this issue.
* Compare the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh. Which do you think is better and why?
