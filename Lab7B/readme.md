# Executive Summary
Talk about what the goal of this lab is !

# Object Oriented Programming
* Create a class (using paper and pencil or using the Microsoft whiteboard app) for the following:
a) Phone
b) House
c) Employee
* Identify the features (In the video for the Car class, we identified the properties as Year, Make Model etc)
* Identify the actions (In the video for the Car class, we identified the methods as Drive, Park, Start etc)
* Then upload a screenshot of your diagram to github for each of the above classes.

# Research Project
* Explain in 2 lines about your research project. Then answer each of the below questions.
* How did you find your sources? What are sources that you should avoid when doing good research?
   * I found all of the sources by searching on google scholar, this way it's safe to assume they're all reliable. 
   Sources you should avoid are ones written by random people that aren't fact checked.
* What did you find most useful about doing this project? What did you learn?
  * I learned about IOT devices and how they are being used, as well as the basics behind how they work and what the security flaws with them are.
* What was the hardest part of doing this project?
  * Finding good sources and figuring out which information to include in the presentation.
* If a team member did not co-operate or had a different idea than yours, explain how you worked with that team member.
    * Everyone cooperated nicely, everything's working out.
