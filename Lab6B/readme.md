# Executive Summary
The point of this lab is to learn the basics of web development, specifically the languages that go into it and how they interact with each other.
# Internet Programming
* Upload screenshots of your html, css and result
* Upload JSON activity

* Who was Tim Berners-Lee and why did he create the W3C?'
  * He's the co-founder and CTO of Inrupt.com and also the founder of the W3C. The point of the W3C is to create a standard for the internet to ensure that all of the websites and browsers are compatible with each other.

* Pick a "standard" of your choice and explain why it is important.\
  * The web design and applications standard is important because it sets standard languages for all websites to use, which makes them compatible and ensures that's not something we'll have to worry about. Imagine if some websites only worked on some browsers.

* What is the purpose of Hypertext Markup Language in Web Programming?
  * It's literally what the webpages themselves are written in, the part of a web page that you see was written in HTML. 
  
* Why do we use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in Web Programming?
   * To make the web page look a certain way, otherwise it would all just be black text on a white background.

* Explain how XML differs from HTML. 
   * XML is basically a framework for markup languages whereas HTML is just for webpages. Also XML has stricter syntax than HTML and is case sensitive. In XML the user can define their own tags and in HTML there are a fixed number of tags. HTML displays the data, XML defines the data.

* What is the advantage of JSON over XML?
    * JSON is shorter
    * JSON is quicker to read and write
    * JSON can use arrays
    * JSON doesn't need a parser, it's part of Javascript. 
# Conclusion
In this lab I learned about the languages that are used in web development and how they work together. I also learned what the W3C is and what they do.
