# Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab

## Hexadecimal color representation
* Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/ 
  * Computers can technically only produce light that is red, green and blue. The hex color codes work by dividing the number into three parts, 
  in this case red=ab green=00 blue=ff. And then you just calculate the value of each segment and that is the rgb value. 
  So ab00ff = RGB(171, 0, 255)
* When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered. 
  * When making a website you need to consider ease of use, use simplistic colors that are not too bright or drastic, colors that flow together nicely. I feel this color (light purple) would in fact be problematic because it's a darker color and that would be difficult to look at. 

## Logic Gates and circuits
* Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate.  
  * A truth table is a table used to show logic gates and what math they're based on. 
  For example: this is an AND table
  | A | B | Output |
  | - | - | ------ |
  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  
* How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate? 
  * The AND gate returns true when both conditions are met, the NAND gate returns true when both conditions are NOT met. 
  NAND just means "not and". So it is the opposite.
* Complete the logic gate exercises word doc and upload to this folder.

## IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
* Explain the purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design
