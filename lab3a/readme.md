# Executive Summary
The goal of this lab is to further understand the different classes of software and how software architecture works.

# Software 
* Explain the roles of application, utility and operating system software. Give an example of each. 
    * Utility software is software that interacts directly with the operating system itself and is used to maintain and use the computer
    * Application software is any other software you would use, the whole purpose of a computer, ex: browsers, games, IDEs, media players, etc.
    * The operating system is the "backbone" of the computer, it is the platform that everything on it runs on and is what makes the hardware actually work.

* Explain the purpose of ERP software and provide an example. 
ERP stands for enterprise resource planning. ERP software is used to help businesses run more efficiently and effectively. Examples of ERP software include POS and Microsoft Dynamics.

# Virtualization

Read the article 
https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-virtualization

* In addition to the chapter use the following resource:  https://www.vmware.com/solutions/virtualization.html#how-it-works
and explain the purpose of virtualization. 
Virtualization refers to creating a virtual enviornment that mimics an operating system rather than an actual machine. 
This is useful to have to systems that are completely independent of each other for security reasons, it's also much cheaper. 

#### Explain the following: 
* What types of problems are solved with virtualization? 
   * It's less expensive, can be more secure, is easier to manage/move around, data can be backed up easier.
* What role does hypervisor play in virtualization? 
   * The hypervisor is the actual software that "makes" the virtual machines. It allocates the resources at its disposal into multiple different virtual operating systems.

#### Cloud computing vs. Virtualization: 
    https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/cloud-vs-virtualization  
 
* In your own words explain the difference between cloud computing and virtualization  
   * Virtualization is when you have a virtual operating system, cloud computing is an unbrella term for an information system where some aspects of it are done over a wireless connection, ex: Icloud or google drive being cloud data storage.

* Explain how a network administrator could move from virtualization to cloud computing? 
   * It's very doable because with virtualization half the infrastructure is already there, you'd just need to add things like databases and maybe a user portal via a website, depending on what it's for.
 
# Conclusion
In this lab I learned what virtualization and cloud computing are and how they are different in spite of their similarities.
