# Executive Summary
In this lab I learned about codes of ethics and how they are
# Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Systems
## Code of Ethics
* Explain the purpose of a "code of ethics" and why the ACM created a code for the computing discipline.
   * A code of ethics is a set of rules that demonstrate what is and isn't considered morally acceptable by an organization. The ACM created their code of ethics as a baseline for others to follow in the industry. 
* Explain the difference between a code of ethics and AUP (acceptable use policies.) 
   * A code of ethics is broader and encompasses your actual behavior whereas an acceptable use policy simply states what you can and cannot use a specific thing for (in this case, software). 
* Pick a site of your choice and read the AUP.  Select a policy of interest and report your findings (include a link to the site in your report.) 
    * This is the fair use policy for YouTube. It states the copyright laws and specifies what does and does not count as original content, as opposed to just copying someone else's work. Specifically, how creating a video ABOUT content that may be copyright is different than just posting the copyrighted work, and therefore is allowed.

## Intellectual Property
* From the chapter follow the link to the WIPO.  What is the purpose and importance of the WIPO? 
  * They are essentially the patent office for intellectual property, they are the backbone of IT based business because they allow people to claim their own ideas and have them not be stolen. 
* Using links in the chapter explain how a copyright is obtained and the benefit of registering for a copyright with the US Copyright Office. Explain why it might be important to copyright the svg image you created. 
* If the svg image you created became an item that identifies a source of goods or services, explain the role of a trademark in defining the intellectual property. 
 
## Information Collection
* Explain how COPPA, FERPA and HIPPA restrict the collection of information on the Internet. 

# URLs and File Paths
* Match the following terms / definitions under the heading and explain how they are related by providing an example of all of the pieces of a URL: 
Terms: scheme, domain, top level domain, default page, parameters, anchor 
Definitions/examples: .edu, no file path provided, result of search, https, www.amazon.com, specific location on a page. 

* What is your understanding of difference between Absolute and Relative File Paths. What would you use in your website? Why?

* Explain the purpose and use of file compression.
