# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab is to understand the different types of intellectual property laws and how they are used to secure the identity of intellectual property.
This lab also goes over URL file paths and how they work.
# Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Systems
## Code of Ethics
* Explain the purpose of a "code of ethics" and why the ACM created a code for the computing discipline.
   * A code of ethics is a set of rules that demonstrate what is and isn't considered morally acceptable by an organization. The ACM created their code of ethics as a baseline for others to follow in the industry. 
* Explain the difference between a code of ethics and AUP (acceptable use policies.) 
   * A code of ethics is broader and encompasses your actual behavior whereas an acceptable use policy simply states what you can and cannot use a specific thing for (in this case, software). 
* Pick a site of your choice and read the AUP.  Select a policy of interest and report your findings (include a link to the site in your report.) 
    * This is the fair use policy for YouTube. It states the copyright laws and specifies what does and does not count as original content, as opposed to just copying someone else's work. Specifically, how creating a video ABOUT content that may be copyright is different than just posting the copyrighted work, and therefore is allowed.

## Intellectual Property
* From the chapter follow the link to the WIPO.  What is the purpose and importance of the WIPO? 
  * They are essentially the patent office for intellectual property, they are the backbone of IT based business because they allow people to claim their own ideas and have them not be stolen. 
* Using links in the chapter explain how a copyright is obtained and the benefit of registering for a copyright with the US Copyright Office. Explain why it might be important to copyright the svg image you created. 
    * You get a copyright by submitting your work to them, you cannot copyright an idea itself, you can only copyright an expression of an idea, such as a book or a song or piece of art you created. This finite definition allows the laws to be enforced since there is one thing that you have the rights to. The benefit of this is that you can sell your work or use it in some official capacity without others taking credit for it. If I were to actually use the SVG image as the logo for a business, I'd need to copyright it so others can't use the brand name for themselves. 
* If the svg image you created became an item that identifies a source of goods or services, explain the role of a trademark in defining the intellectual property. 
    * Trademarks are essentially copyrights for business organizations, if the logo became a brand name, it would be trademarked. A trademark has slightly different implications and is meant for business, it just states that you are the only one who can distribute goods and services under that brand name.
 
## Information Collection
* Explain how COPPA, FERPA and HIPPA restrict the collection of information on the Internet. 
    * COPPA stands for children's online privacy protection act and makes it illegal to collect information on anyone under 13 years old. This applies to websites that track you so they can give you ads relevant to what you're interested in, since that reasoning is not why they actually do it, COPPA makes it illegal to collect information on children who can't fight for themselves. 
    FERPA stands for Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and it protects information pertaining to children's school affairs, such as their behavior and grades. 
    It's similar to COPPA but more specific.
    HIPPA states that parents always have the right to know anything that happens with their student's health while at school, or just in general.

# URLs and File Paths
* Match the following terms / definitions under the heading and explain how they are related by providing an example of all of the pieces of a URL: 
Terms: scheme, domain, top level domain, default page, parameters, anchor 
Definitions/examples: .edu, no file path provided, result of search, https, www.amazon.com, specific location on a page. 

| Terms | Definitions |
| --- | --- |
| Scheme | Result Of Search |
| Domain | www.amazon.com |
| Top Level Domain | .edu |
| No File Path Provided | Default Page |
| Parameters | https |
| Anchor | Specific Location On Page |

* What is your understanding of difference between Absolute and Relative File Paths. What would you use in your website? Why?
    * Absolute file paths are written as the entire path, so the base directory and everything all the way down. Relative file paths are written based on the current working directory. 
    For example:
    
    Absolute Path: C:\users\username\desktop\photos\photo.jpg
    
    Relative Path (From desktop): photos\photo.png

* Explain the purpose and use of file compression.
    * It's used to make files smaller, it has multiple different uses. Sometimes the files are compressed to be downloaded/uploaded faster or sometimes it's compressed "permanently" like in a JPG format. It's used to save memory.

# Conclusion
In this lab I learned about codes of ethics and how they are used in business/organizations in general, as well as intellectual property laws. 
I also learned about URL file paths.
