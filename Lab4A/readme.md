# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab is to learn about computer graphics. Specifically the different types of images and image compression, as well as the basics of windows command line.

# Graphics
## Raster vs. Vector Graphics
* Explain the difference between a raster and vector image.  
  * Raster images are made up of pixels and vector images are made up of paths that are worked out mathematically. 
 Technically, all images are displayed using pixels, but the pixels in a raster image are much larger than the basic ones that make up your screen. 
 In general, vector images take up much less memory. On a vector image you can zoom in and the quality doesn't detiorate because the pixels used to represent it are relative. 
 With raster images it's the opposite, when you zoom in the quality is worse.
 
* Include examples of when each would be most appropriate 
  * A raster image would make sense for normal pictures like photos you take on your phone or screenshots. Vectors are typically used with clipart and are basic, transparent images used as components of a larger graphic design.

## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
* Why does it matter to developers whether they use lossless or lossy image formats?  
  * If an image is going to be compressed and then unzipped repeatedly, it makes sense to use lossless compression so it can retain its quality, if it's a large image only being compressed once, lossy may be acceptable.
 

## File Formats
* Explain the similarities and differences between jpg, gif and png files. 
 * The difference between JPG and PNG is that PNG uses lossless compression and JPG uses lossy compression. GIF files are essentially the older version of PNG files. 
 PNGs are best for photos with high contrast, illustrations, things that need a transparent background. 
 JPEGs are best for larger photographs that need to be compressed because the file size is too large. 
 GIFs are primarily used for animations. 

# Operating Systems
Upload screenshots for Operating System tasks to github

## Logo
* Upload your logo image that you created from the Graphics Tasks
* Explain your image design including how many "layers" were required
* Right-click on your svg image file, select "properties" and report the file size and what application it "opens with." What application might be more appropriate and why (click the "change" button for options)
